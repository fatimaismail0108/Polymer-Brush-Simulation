# Polymer-Brush-Coating-Simulation

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation in Python to study the behavior of different polymer brush architectures as surface coatings. The goal is to identify which polymer brush — block copolymer or alternating copolymer — is optimal for coating applications.

Overview

Simulated polymer brush behavior using the Metropolis criterion, tracking system evolution over multiple iterations.

Compared the stability and performance of block vs alternating copolymers under varying conditions.

Focused on computational efficiency for client-oriented applications while maintaining high physical accuracy.

Analysed results via quantitative metrics and plots to evaluate polymer performance.

Tools & Techniques

Python – core simulation and data processing

Matplotlib – visualisation of system evolution and comparison of polymer architectures

Monte Carlo Methods – stochastic simulation using Metropolis criterion

Outcomes

Determined which polymer brush architecture is more stable and suitable as a surface coating.

Produced detailed plots to support data-driven material selection and engineering decisions.

Optimized simulation for both accuracy and efficiency, enabling practical client use.
